# Wordgame

Primitive realisation of well-known game Scrabble as a problem set of the course
"MITx: 6.00.1x Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python" at edx.org.

Compatibility: Python 3.4+.


The game is interactive and intended to be lauched in a console.
It reads a set of words from the included words.txt file.

A user has to compose words with letters in current hand (set of letters) to move forward.

The final function playGame() has been implemented via helper functions:

— def updateHand(hand, word):
    """
    Assumes that 'hand' has all the letters in word.
    In other words, this assumes that however many times
    a letter appears in 'word', 'hand' has at least as
    many of that letter in it. 

    Updates the hand: uses up the letters in the given word
    and returns the new hand, without those letters in it.

    Has no side effects: does not modify hand.

    word: string
    hand: dictionary (string -> int)    
    returns: dictionary (string -> int)
    """

— def isValidWord(word, hand, wordList):
    """
    Returns True if word is in the wordList and is entirely
    composed of letters in the hand. Otherwise, returns False.

    Does not mutate hand or wordList.
   
    word: string
    hand: dictionary (string -> int)
    wordList: list of lowercase strings
    """

— def calculateHandlen(hand):
    """ 
    Returns the length (number of letters) in the current hand.
    
    hand: dictionary (string-> int)
    returns: integer
    """

— def playHand(hand, wordList, n):
    """
    Allows the user to play the given hand, as follows:

    * The hand is displayed.
    * The user may input a word or a single period (the string ".") 
      to indicate they're done playing
    * Invalid words are rejected, and a message is displayed asking
      the user to choose another word until they enter a valid word or "."
    * When a valid word is entered, it uses up letters from the hand.
    * After every valid word: the score for that word is displayed,
      the remaining letters in the hand are displayed, and the user
      is asked to input another word.
    * The sum of the word scores is displayed when the hand finishes.
    * The hand finishes when there are no more unused letters or the user
      inputs a "."

      hand: dictionary (string -> int)
      wordList: list of lowercase strings
      n: integer (HAND_SIZE; i.e., hand size required for additional points)
      
    """
